Course "Program Engineering" at the University Undergraduate Study of Informatics, led by Assoc. Ph.D. Nikola Tanković, is required for the third year of study in the winter semester. The course is held in hall 402 of the new FET building "Dr. Mijo Mirković" in the Croatian language and has 6 ECTS credits. Prerequisites for admission include completed courses Programming, Databases I and Advanced Programming Techniques. The aim of the course is to acquaint students with modern techniques for developing software applications and systems, and to master applicable paradigms, programming languages, libraries and frameworks.

Studenti su obvezni pohađati nastavu, izraditi projektni zadatak, pristupiti kontrolnim zadaćama i usmenom ispitu. Projektni zadatak nosi 50% ocjene, kontrolne zadaće 10%, a usmeni ispit 40%. Da bi položili kolegij, studenti moraju ostvariti najmanje 50% bodova putem aktivnosti kontinuiranog praćenja ili pristupiti završnom ispitu.
6. Tools for managing versions of program code. The Git tool, the GitHub service, and the collaborative development process. 7. Data storage systems in the cloud Firebase Firestore and Storage. 8. Verification of program support. Unit tests and end-to-end type tests. A system for continuous software integration.
Planned activities, learning and teaching methods and assessment methods Obligations Outcomes Hours ECTS Maximum share in the grade (%) Attendance at classes 1-6 28 1.0 0% Project 1-7 98 3.5 50% Control tasks 1-6 14 0, 5 10% Oral exam 1-6 28 1.0 40% Total 168 6.0 100% Additional clarifications (evaluation criteria): Class attendance: During lectures, students are presented with concepts related to the development of distributed multi-layer applications and are illustrated with practical examples through exercises in the computer laboratory.   Project assignment: Students are required to independently choose the topic of project assignments approved by the teacher. The thematic framework and the required amount of functionality will be defined in advance. When creating a project assignment, it is possible to independently choose the used programming languages ​​and frameworks. The project task needs to be realized through two components: the application prototype and the application itself. Students are required to place the created project on one of the source code version management systems, which will be used to monitor the progress in building the project, and additionally place a link to the source code in the designated place on e-learning. A successfully defended project carries a maximum of 50 points, of which 5 points refer to the prototype, 20 points to the client components, 20 points to the server components and 5 points to the presentation of the project. Using someone else's solution (plagiarism) is prohibited and entails disciplinary liability.  Control tasks: During the course, knowledge tests will be conducted, which will proportionally contribute to the final points in the maximum amount of 10%. Each check consists in realizing the required functionality using script languages ​​and libraries covered in previous lectures.  Oral exam: At the oral exam in the last week of classes, knowledge of the presented course material is determined in accordance with the learning outcomes. It is possible to earn up to 40% points.  The exam is passed if the student achieves at least 50% points through continuous monitoring activities during the semester. The assessment of continuous monitoring is based on the achieved points according to the following scale:
The text provides basic information about variables and operators in JavaScript, including the rules for declaring variables with `const', different data types, and the use of strings and exponential notation. Explains basic operators such as arithmetic, association, comparison, logical, and type operators, and their uses. JavaScript is used to create interactive web pages, as well as server-side, desktop and mobile applications. There are three ways to write JavaScript code in a web browser: inline, internal, and external JavaScript.
